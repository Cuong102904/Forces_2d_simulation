# OOP-2023.2-Group 22

Mini-project for OOP 2023, HUST.

## Introduction

This project presents the creation of a simple interactive simulation to demonstrate Newtonâ€™s laws of motion, providing an insightful educational tool for understanding dynamics. The simulation allows users to control a physical system composed of three main components: a main object, a friction, and an actor applying a horizontal force. Users can select either a cube-shaped or cylinder-shaped object, specifying parameters such as side length, radius, and mass. The actor applies force to the object's center of mass, represented by a horizontal arrow, with adjustable strength and direction.
